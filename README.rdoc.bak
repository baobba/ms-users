== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version: ruby 2.2.1p85 (2015-02-26 revision 49769) [x86_64-linux]

* System dependencies:
	- MongoDB: MongoDB shell version: 2.4.9


* Configuration
	- Set the environment variable SECRET_KEY_BASE (use the command "rake secret")

* Database initialization
	- From rails console, create a Client first with admin permissions. Beware it may throw a 400 Bad Request error due to Mailgun bad setup. Just ignore it. Use:
		- c = FactoryGirl.create(:client_admin)
		- c.skip_confirmation!

* How to run the test suite
	- run command "rspec"

Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
